# rusterizer

A simple, CLI-based rasterizer, adapted from a C++ project as a learning exercise for the Rust programming language.
```
Usage: rusterizer Meshfile Imagefile image_width image_height [-w | --wireframe]
```
Supported Meshfiles: .obj
Supported Imagefiles: .png

Currently a work in progress, although most components are considered complete at this point.
